## Quick Setup: Enable Security Scan

This repository includes a pre-configured Bandit security scan workflow for automated security checks, but it needs to be manually enabled:

**To activate the Security Scan:**

1. Rename [.github/security-scan.yml.example](.github/security-scan.yml.example) to `.github/security-scan.yml`
2. Move the file from [.github](.github) to the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder
3. Commit and push the change

**Why this step is needed:**
GitHub Actions security restrictions prevent automatic creation of workflow files during template initialisation.
Learn more about [GitHub Token permissions and workflow limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token).

Once enabled, the Security Scan will automatically run on all Pull Requests and commits to `main`, checking for:

- Common security issues in Python code
- Hardcoded passwords, API keys, and tokens
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Use of insecure functions and libraries

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Version specified in `.python-version`.
2. **[{{ package_manager | title }}]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }})**: This is used to manage package dependencies and virtual
   environments.
3. **Operation System**: MacOS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/{{ repository_owner }}/{{ repository_name }}.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   [{{ package_manager | title }}]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }}) is used to manage dependencies in this project. For more information, read
   the [{{ package_manager | title }} documentation]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }}).

   To install all dependencies, including development dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   make install-dev
   ```

   To install only production dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. Run the application

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## Development

Get started with development by running the following commands.
Before proceeding, make sure you have the development dependencies installed using the `make install-dev` command.

A Makefile is provided to simplify common development tasks. To view all available commands, run:

```bash
make
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

The unit tests are written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework. To run the tests and check
coverage, run:

```bash
make test
```

### Linting and Formatting

[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is used for both linting and formatting of the Python code in this project.
Ruff is a fast Python linter and formatter that replaces multiple tools with a single, efficient solution.

The tool is configured using the `pyproject.toml` file.

To lint the Python code, run:

```bash
make lint
```

To auto-format the Python code and correct fixable linting issues, run:

```bash
make format
```

### Security Scanning

[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used for security scanning of the Python code.
It helps identify common security issues in Python applications.

To run the security scan, run:

```bash
make security-scan
```

{% if enable_auto_fix_workflows %}
### Optional auto-fix workflows

If you'd like GitHub Actions to *commit back fixes* automatically:

1. **Create a Personal Access Token (classic)** with `repo` → `contents:write` scope.  
      1. Go to [generate new token](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new)
      2. Name the token. Change the `Resource owner` to `{{ repository_owner }}` 
      3. In Repository Access choose `Only select repositories`. Select the repository `{{ reposity_owner }}/{{ repository_name }}`
      4. Click `Repository permissions`. Scroll to the `Contents` row and change the `Access: no access` to `Access: Read and Write`
      5. Scroll to the bottom and click `Generate token and request access`
      6. Copy the PAT beginning with `github_pat_`
      7. Go to your repository secrets ([link here](https://github.com/{{ repository_owner }}/{{ repository_name }}/settings/secrets/actions)) and add it to the `Repository secrets` with the name `PAT_TOKEN` and the value of the PAT.

2. Enable the example workflows provided in `.github`:

   ```text
   # Ruff (format + lint-fix)
   mv .github/ruff-fix.yml.example .github/workflows/ruff-fix.yml

   # Bandit baseline/suppressions generation
   mv .github/security-scan-fix.yml.example .github/workflows/security-scan-fix.yml
   ```
3. Commit & push.

What they do:

* **ruff-fix** – runs `make format` (Ruff formatting + autofix) and, if code changed, commits the diff back to the branch using the `PAT_TOKEN`.
* **security-scan-fix** – runs Bandit and, when new findings appear, (re)generates `bandit.baseline` so subsequent scans only fail on *new* vulnerabilities, then commits it back.

> Without the PAT token the commit made by the workflow would not trigger other workflows (GitHub protection against endless loops).
{% endif %}

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The project includes pre-commit hooks to automatically run linting, formatting, and security checks before each commit.

1. Install **pre-commit** using your selected package manager:

   {% if package_manager == 'poetry' %}
   ```bash
   poetry add --group dev pre-commit
   ```
   {% elif package_manager == 'pipenv' %}
   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev pre-commit
   ```
   {% else %}
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```
   {% endif %}

2. Activate the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

From now on Ruff and Bandit will run automatically on the files you stage before every commit.
