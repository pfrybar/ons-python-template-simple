## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Pre-requisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Version specified in `.python-version`.
2. **[{{ package_manager | title }}]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }})**: This is used to manage package dependencies and virtual
   environments.
3. **Operation System**: MacOS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{{ repository_owner }}/{{ repository_name }}.git
```

2. Install dependencies

[{{ package_manager | title }}]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }}) is used to manage dependencies in this project. For more information, read
the [{{ package_manager | title }} documentation]({{ macros.package_manager_url() }}).

To install all dependencies, including development dependencies, run:

```bash
make install-dev
```

To install only production dependencies, run:

```bash
make install
   ```

3. Run the application

```bash
make run
```

## Development

Get started with development by running the following commands.
Before proceeding, make sure you have the development dependencies installed using the `make install-dev` command.

A Makefile is provided to simplify common development tasks. To view all available commands, run:

```bash
make
```

### Run Tests with Coverage

The unit tests are written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) framework. To run the tests and check
coverage, run:

```bash
make test
```

### Linting and Formatting

[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) is used for both linting and formatting of the Python code in this project.
Ruff is a fast Python linter and formatter that replaces multiple tools with a single, efficient solution.

The tool is configured using the `pyproject.toml` file.

To lint the Python code, run:

```bash
make lint
```

To auto-format the Python code and correct fixable linting issues, run:

```bash
make format
```

### Security Scanning

[Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is used for security scanning of the Python code.
It helps identify common security issues in Python applications.

To run the security scan, run:

```bash
make security-scan
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The project includes pre-commit hooks to automatically run linting, formatting, and security checks before each commit.

1. Install **pre-commit** using your selected package manager:

{% if package_manager == 'poetry' %}
```bash
poetry add --group dev pre-commit
```
{% elif package_manager == 'pipenv' %}
```bash
pipenv install --dev pre-commit
```
{% else %}
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
{% endif %}

2. Activate the git hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

From now on Ruff and Bandit will run automatically on the files you stage before every commit.
